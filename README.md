## Overview
The Tableau Cloud app for Microsoft M365 is an app in the MSFT Teams Marketplace that makes it easy to consume your content within Teams and Office.  Currently, the app is enabled as a [Teams app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/apps-in-teams#partner-apps-created-by-independent-app-developers) as well as an [Office addin](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/overview/office-add-ins).  It can be used from the below Microsoft Products:

* Microsoft Teams
* Microsoft Word
* Microsoft PowerPoint


As the name implies, the version in the Teams Marketplace is only for Tableau Cloud.  It is also possible to use app with Tableau Server, by side-loading the app package from this repository.  Side-loading is required, because the app manifest needs to be updated to point to the customer's Tableau Server environment domains.  See the [Setup Guide](SETUP.md) for additional details.
